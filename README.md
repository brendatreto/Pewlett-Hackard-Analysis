# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
In preparation for the upcoming 'silver tsnuami' PH is getting its data ready. They had a thorough collection of data from its employees but it needed an upgrade. Using newer programming languages we intended to make it easier to read and analyze.

## Resources

These images show the result of the analysis and we can confidently say:
1. Almost 70% of the retiring employees hold a senior position
2. Mangerial positions will not be affected by this 'silver tsunami' which can make the transition easier
3. There is a severe mismatch in the number of mentorship elegible employees (1,549) and retiring employees (~133,000) (or positions to fill).
4. The majority of elegible employees for the mentorship programs also hold senior positions.
